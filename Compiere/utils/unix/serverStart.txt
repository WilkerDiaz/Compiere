Here is a startup sript we made for the compiere server
(running on Fedora Core 1).
It assumes there is a user "compiere" with a home directory
"/opt/compiere" who has all the necessary environment
settings in "/opt/compiere/.bash_profile".
The script will have to be adjusted to your own environment
by setting the appropriate variables.

One advantage of this script is that it really waits until
the server decalres it is started up or shut down before
echoing "[OK]" to the screen.

A major disadvantage is that it runs the server as root,
which is necessary to log the output to the
/var/log/compiere.log.
